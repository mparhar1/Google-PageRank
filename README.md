# Google PageRank Algorithm
This implementation of a simplified version of the Google PageRank algorithm was completed as a course project. This uses C programs in Visual Studios to invoke the MATLAB engine to process data.

# Description
PageRank is a sorting algorithm used by Google to rank web pages that appear in their search results. This simplified version of the PageRank algorithm works by counting the amount of sources containing links to a webpage. Then to determine the importantance of each page, the probability of getting to each page from all of the other pages is calulcated. The webpage results are then ranked from highest to lowest probability.
